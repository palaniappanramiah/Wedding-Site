				<h1>Srini</h1><img class="img-circle" src="images/boy.jpg"><br/>
				<p id="srinistory">I couldn't get those enticing eyes off her. I wondered if she had noticed me. I lay my eyes on hers; I could live forever, on this newly found sight. It was serene. I gathered all might, breathed in deep, when she took the seat next to me. I happened to lay one irresistible glance again, and felt the moment.<br/><br/> In the next two hours, with a book under my desk, I wrote the best exam in a long time. I was conscious of her periodic stare; of course it was my copying she panicked. With constant deliberations to meet her or not to, days went by and nothing happened.<br/><br/> Until one day, I realized she had visited my Facebook page. It has been a blissful life ever since. She accepted my friend request a day later. We met again. A year later, I let her know &ndash; I fell in love, and I wanted to love her for a lifetime.<br/><br/>Sometimes you just look into someone's eyes and know, those are the eyes you want to get lost in for the rest of your life. I'm glad I held on to my intuitions. Just because, she is a sky full of stars.<br/><br/></p>

				<p id="anjaanstory">Last minute scurrying, and I'm finally at my desk. I shut it all out and looked around the exam hall - the black board few desks away, my tense friends, and the loud recitals of by-hearted code. Suddenly, it was all mute to me. A blur of red shirt near the doorway caught my eye. He created an ambiance that pulled me out of my bearing.<br/><br/> My eyes followed the handsome demeanor, up till his seat, three rows in the front. And thoughts suspended to the invigilator's instructions to follow the seating arrangements. After all the commotions we settled at our places, where I found mine next to him.<br/><br/>For the first time, it was endearing to sit in the exam hall. And I wrote away, two hours of my exam, with not a speck of thought in mind that 5 years later, I would choose to marry this man (who at that time was busy copying answers from a huge data book), in the same month as we met.<br/><br/>We have shared till this day, a beautiful friendship, our share of fights and unmeasured love. He bestowed a belief in me, a faith I treasured and a boundless freedom to be who I am today!</p>
